# Student_CRUD_Operation
This project demonstrates a simple menu-driven CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing student records using C# and MySQL. It allows users to add new students, view student details, update existing records, and delete entries via console input. The application connects to a MySQL database for persistent storage.
